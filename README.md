# MAGD150
Small deposit of some class projects.
This repository was made for MAGD 150, section 2



I have added Lab 3, Lab 5, and Lab 8

Lab 3 consisted of making a program that uses functions such as mouse position, framerate, and math functions

Lab 5 consisted of making a "Functioning" TV or monitor, using mouse clicked/pressed commands, and keypressed commands in order to change a TV

Lab 8 consisted of uploading image files, and making them move via mouse position, as well as adding typography by adding a text function and switing the hight, width, and font
